    <h2>Akka Cluster Play Frontend</h2>

    <p>
        This is a small akka cluster application with a play frontend to show
        <ul>
            <li>The current cluster state</li>
            <li>Start jobs in the cluster</li>
        </ul>
        
        It is based on two other amazing activator templates. For the play part
        I used the <a href="http://typesafe.com/activator/template/play-angular-require-seed">"play angular require seed"</a>
        by Marius Soutier and for the backend part I used parts of the <a href=http://typesafe.com/activator/template/akka-sample-cluster-scala>
        "akka sample cluster in scala"</a> template. Check these out if the docs on this one are sufficient enough.
    </p>

    <p>The tutorial is strucuture in the following way
        <ul>
            <li>Getting Started</li>
            <li>Application Architecture</li>
            <li>Cluster State Frontend</li>
            <li>Factorial Frontend</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    
    <p>
        Open three terminals at the project root and run in each of them
        one line of the following commands:
        
        <pre><code>sbt "project backend" "run 2551"
sbt "project backend" "run 2552"
sbt "project frontend" run</code></pre>
        
        The first two lines boot the cluster seed nodes. The last one starts the frontend,
        which needs at least one seed node to be up and running to join the cluster.
    </p>
    
    <p>Now go to <a href="http://localhost:9000">localhost:9000</a> and enjoy the frontend.
       Every page is backed by a websocket, so you do not need to releoad any page, every!
    <p>
        If you want to fire up more cluster nodes, run this in a new terminal:
        <pre><code>sbt "project backend" run</code></pre>
    </p>
    
</div>


<div>
    <h2>Application Architecture</h2>
    
    <p> The application is split up in three subprojects.
        <ul>
            <li><em>api</em>: contains all messages which can be send by the <em>frontend</em> to the <em>backend</em></li>
            <li><em>frontend</em>: playframework frontend. Depends on and aggregates the <em>api</em> project</li>
            <li><em>backend</em>: the akka cluster node. Implements actors which can handle the messages defined in <em>api</em></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Cluster State Frontend</h2>
    
    <p>
        At <a href="http://localhost:9000/#/dashboard">localhost:9000/#/dashboard</a> you find a minimal dashboard,
        which shows the current nodes available in the cluster. Open a new terminal and run:
        <pre><code>sbt "project backend" run</code></pre>
        After a short time you will see a new backend node appearing. If you kill that console, the nodes state
        will change to <em>unreachable</em> and will then be removed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This dashboard also includes some stats about the cluster, like memory consumption of each node.
        These information are more accurate if you put the native sigar library on your classpath, which
        is only available for the backend cluster.<br>
        Take a look at the <a href=http://typesafe.com/activator/template/akka-sample-cluster-scala>akka-sample-cluster-scala</a>
        activator to see how you can achieve this. The graph is rendered via d3js in a defined
        angularjs directive (in <em>frontend/assets/js/dashboard/directives</em>). 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Behind the scenes there are two websockets which update the data. 
        The <em>MonitorActor</em> is responsible for the cluster state changes
        and the <em>MetricsActor</em> for the cluster metric changes. You could
        put them in one actor aswell, which listens for all the events.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Factorial Frontend</h2>
    
    <p>
        This example demonstrates how to submit tasks to the cluster.
        At <a href="http://localhost:9000/#/services/factorial">localhost:9000/#/services/factorial</a>
        you can submit a factorial calculation n times to the cluster. On the right you see how many
        factorials are already computed and how long it took.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The backend implements the actual computation within the <em>factorial.Service.scala</em>.
        The <em>WorkerActor</em> does the job and the <em>FactorialBackend</em> is just for creating
        the backend actor, which is called by the frontend.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The instantiation of the worker actors is done by the frontend. The piece of configuration
        in the <em>application.conf</em> looks like this:
        <pre><code>
akka.actor.deployment {
  /factorialService/factorialWorkerRouter = {
    router = adaptive-group

    metrics-selector = mix
    nr-of-instances = 100
    routees.paths = ["/user/factorialBackend"]
    cluster {
      enabled = on
      use-role = backend
      allow-local-routees = off
    }
  }
}
        </code></pre>
    
        The <em>factorialService</em> actor is register at startup time via the <em>Global.scala</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>Thanks</h2>
    
    Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/2m">Martynas Mickeviƒçius</a> for giving advice on
    the implementation of this. Also special thanks to the other activator template, which is based
    this template on, for the great work and helpful explanations.
